# Writing Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch (no ML libraries) 
Implementation of various machine learning algorithms on a binary classification task.

## Data
The data are from Titanic survival dataset from Kaggle.com. This is a beginner's level competition where competitors use information about the Titanic passengers to predict if they survived or perished on the sinking ship.

## Algorithms Implemented
<ol>
<li>Logistic Regression</li>
<li>K-Nearest Neighbors</li>
<li>Decision Tree</li>
</ol>

I built these algorithms without the use of step-by-step tutorials and these were simply meant as challenges for myself. I am currently working on making the decision tree algorithms more efficient, and plan to implement other algorithms including a random forest.
